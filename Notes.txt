In regards to accessing admin views: (facilities, rooms, rounds, etc)
These are currently viewable from non admin accounts but can only be changed from the CA account
this is achieved using the following code in the controller:
        public ActionResult Create()
        {
            string accName = User.Identity.Name;
            if (accName == "CA")
            {
                return View();
            }
            else
            {
                return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
            }
        } 
so when another username tries to access the page, they are redirected to the index page under Home (probably a splash screen)
also in the view: 
@if (@Html.Encode(User.Identity.Name)=="CA")
            
{
	@Html.ActionLink("Edit", "Edit", new { id=item.FacilityId })

	@Html.ActionLink("Details", "Details", new { id=item.FacilityId })

	@Html.ActionLink("Delete", "Delete", new { id=item.FacilityId })

}
            
else
            
{
                
	@Html.ActionLink("Details", "Details", new { id = item.FacilityId })
            
}

So when another use views the index page (where everything is listed) the links for delete and edit are not there. The same code has been applied to the code for adding a link to create.

This has been applied to the three admin features (facilities, rooms, rounds). some more cleaning is required:
editing/viewing/deleting rooms doesn't work due to the full stops in the id, this could be fixed by giving each room a numerical id in the database
editing rooms doesn't allow the user to edit the facilities in a room
editing rounds requires the user to type in a date/time, this should be made more user friendly
